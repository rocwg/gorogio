## Packages

Every Go program is made up of packages.

Programs start running in package `main`.

This program is using the packages with import paths `"fmt"` and `"math/rand"`.

By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path. For instance, the `"math/rand"` package comprises files that begin with the statement `package rand`.

## Imports

This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.

You can also write multiple import statements, like:

```go
import "fmt"
import "math"
```

But it is good style to use the factored import statement.

## Exported names

In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. For example, `Pizza` is an exported name, as is `Pi`, which is exported from the `math` package.

`pizza` and `pi` do not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.

When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

Run the code. Notice the error message.

To fix the error, rename `math.pi` to `math.Pi` and try it again.

## Functions

A function can take zero or more arguments.

In this example, `add` takes two parameters of type `int`.

Notice that the type comes *after* the variable name.
